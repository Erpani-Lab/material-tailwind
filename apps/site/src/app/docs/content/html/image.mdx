# Tailwind CSS Image

Our Tailwind CSS Image component simplifies image handling and styling, offering an array of classes to achieve the image effects that you are looking for in your website or application.

From adjusting image sizes to creating visually appealing galleries, Tailwind CSS empowers you to optimize and customize your web images with ease.

See below our examples of image UI components.

## Image Demo

This example displays a simple image within a scrollable, centered grid layout. The responsive design classes ensure that the layout adapts to different screen sizes, enhancing the user experience across devices.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="image/image-demo.tsx" language="html" />

## Image with Rounded Corners

Check this example to see how you can implement rounded corners for your images.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="image/image-with-rounded-corners.tsx" language="html" />

---

## Circular Image

Use `rounded-full` class to round the corners of the image into a circle. This effect will be most noticeable if the image is square; otherwise, the image will look elliptical.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="image/circular-image.tsx" language="html" />

---

## Image with Shadow

In this example, the `shadow-xl shadow-black/25` classes add a large shadow effect with a black color and opacity (25%). This creates a sense of depth and improves the image visually from its background, making it stand out more prominently.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="image/image-with-shadow.tsx" language="html" />

## Image with Caption

Use this example if you want to include a caption below the image. Adding images with captions enriches the content and provides visual breaks in the text.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="image/image-with-caption.tsx" language="html" />

## Image with Blurred Caption

In the example below, the styling includes a semi-transparent white background with a blur effect (`backdrop-blur-md`), making the text readable regardless of the image behind it. The border, padding, and shadow improve visibility and aesthetic appeal.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="image/image-with-blurred-caption.tsx" language="html" />
