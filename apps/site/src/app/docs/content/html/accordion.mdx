# Tailwind CSS Accordion

Material Tailwind offers a robust accordion component built with Tailwind CSS that is perfect for situations where you need to integrate expand/collapse design.

The accordion is a UI component that allows the user to show and hide sections of related content on a page. There are many ways to use this component, like displaying a list of FAQs, showing various menus and submenus, displaying the locations of a particular company, and so on.

We created a series of accordion examples to help you build easier your application or website. All these examples are styled with Tailwind CSS and based on Material Design. Check them below.
