# Tailwind CSS Icon Button

Get started with our icon-only button components styled with Tailwind CSS flex and hover utilities. These buttons are perfect for creating compact, visually intuitive actions in your web projects.

These types of buttons provide a visually intuitive way to interact with an application or website. The use of icons can help save space on the user interface and make it easier for users to recognize and understand the action associated with the button. Think about the trash bin icon for deleting items, a pencil icon for editing content, or a magnifying glass icon for search action.

Below we showcased examples of icon buttons that you can use for your project. For the examples below we used [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com/) icons but you can use any icon library you prefer.
