# Tailwind CSS Progress

Our Tailwind CSS progress component can be used to show a user how far along he is in a process. The progress can be determinate or indeterminate. Use the Progress Bar to show an ongoing process that takes a noticeable time to finish.

Below we are presenting our examples of progress components that you can use in your Tailwind CSS project. They come in different styles so you can adapt them easily to your needs.
