## Select Demo

Use this simple spinner consisting of two concentric circles forming the spinning motion. This simplicity ensures that the spinner doesn't distract users from the main content of the application.

## Select Colors

Check out this loading spinner component, with customizable stroke colors. The colors used in the SVG elements is (`text-surface`) for the spinning animation, while the strokes of the paths within each SVG have different colors: `primary`, `secondary`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, and `error`. Choose the color that suits your project's needs.

## Select Disabled

In the code snipped above, the animation applied to the spinner (`animate-spin`) adds movement, further indicating that a process is ongoing. The use of the `text-surface` class for coloring provides a subtle gray color, which maintains visibility while ensuring it doesn't distract too much from the content behind it and the `w-16 h-16` classes set a bigger size for the spinner.
