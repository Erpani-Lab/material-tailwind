# Tailwind CSS Chip

Get started on your web projects with our Tailwind CSS Chip (also known as Pills or Tags) which is a compact element that represents an input, attribute, or action. This element appears dynamically as a group of multiple interactive elements and allows users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions.

They often come with the capability to be removed or interacted with, allowing users to manipulate the data or selection represented by the chip.

See below our responsive chip component examples styled with Tailwind CSS that you can use for your web or mobile projects.

## Chip Sizes

Check out this example to see how you can implement chips with different sizes. The differences in size are primarily achieved through varying the padding values (small - `px-2 py-1`; large - `px-4 py-2`).

## Chip Components Best Practices for Developers

<ul className="space-y-2 list-disc list-outside text-foreground mt-4 ml-4">
<li>Chips should have concise and descriptive labels that clearly convey their purpose or the information they represent.</li>
<li>Keep a consistent look and feel for chips across your application to maintain a cohesive user interface.</li>
<li>For chips that perform actions (e.g., deletable or selectable chips), make it clear that they are interactive.</li>
<li>Ensure that chips are large enough to be easily tapped on touch devices, following recommended touch target sizes.</li>
<li>Avoid overwhelming users with too many chips at once.</li>
</ul>
