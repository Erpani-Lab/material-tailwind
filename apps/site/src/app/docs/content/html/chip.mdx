# Tailwind CSS Chip

Get started on your web projects with our Tailwind CSS Chip (also known as Pills or Tags) which is a compact element that represents an input, attribute, or action. This element appears dynamically as a group of multiple interactive elements and allows users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions.

They often come with the capability to be removed or interacted with, allowing users to manipulate the data or selection represented by the chip.

See below our responsive chip component examples styled with Tailwind CSS that you can use for your web or mobile projects.
