# Tailwind CSS Input

Easily create inputs with different statuses and sizes using our components based on Tailwind CSS.

Input fields are an essential user interface design element, providing users with the means to enter non-standardized responses. Input components are critical for gathering user input in a structured format, facilitating interaction between the user and the application.

They are used extensively in forms for registrations, logins, searches, and data entry tasks across various platforms. The design and functionality of input components can significantly impact the usability and user experience of an application, making it important for developers and designers to choose the appropriate type of input for the data they wish to collect from users.

See below Material Tailwind's input component examples.

## Input Disabled

Implement clear visual feedback for non-interactive form fields with this disabled input component. Using Tailwind CSS state modifiers and custom styling, it effectively communicates the input's inactive status to users.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="input/input-disabled.tsx" language="html" />

<p class="mt-4 antialiased text-foreground">
The input is explicitly marked as disabled (`disabled attribute`), which prevents user interaction. The styling reflects this state by altering the border and background color (`disabled:border-0 disabled:bg-blue-gray-50`), making it visually distinct from active input fields. This design choice helps users recognize that the input is not currently available for interaction.
