# Tailwind CSS Input

Easily create inputs with different statuses and sizes using our components based on Tailwind CSS.

Input fields are an essential user interface design element, providing users with the means to enter non-standardized responses. Input components are critical for gathering user input in a structured format, facilitating interaction between the user and the application.

They are used extensively in forms for registrations, logins, searches, and data entry tasks across various platforms. The design and functionality of input components can significantly impact the usability and user experience of an application, making it important for developers and designers to choose the appropriate type of input for the data they wish to collect from users.

See below Material Tailwind's input component examples.

## Input Color

The 6 examples of input components showcased below are HTML snippets styled with Tailwind CSS, each designed to highlight a different focus color theme: Primary, Secondary, Info, Success, Warning and Error. They share a common structure and styling with slight variations in color to differentiate them.

## Input with Validation

These input examples styled with Tailwind CSS are structured to visually communicate feedback to the user through color-coded cues. Each example represents different states or feedback contexts for user interaction: an error state (red-themed - `border-red-500`, `text-red-500`) and a success state (green-themed - `border-green-500`, `text-green-500`).

## Input with Button

Use the example below for an input containing a button inside. It is useful for forms where users can enter an email address and then take an action, such as inviting a user to a platform or sending a notification.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="input/input-with-button.tsx" language="html" />

## Input with Dropdown

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="input/input-with-dropdown.tsx" language="html" />

---

## Input Disabled

Use this example if you want to clearly indicate to users that the input field is currently not interactive, employing visual cues and styling to convey its disabled state.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="input/input-disabled.tsx" language="html" />

<p class="mt-4 antialiased text-foreground">
The input is explicitly marked as disabled (`disabled attribute`), which prevents user interaction. The styling reflects this state by altering the border and background color (`disabled:border-0 disabled:bg-blue-gray-50`), making it visually distinct from active input fields. This design choice helps users recognize that the input is not currently available for interaction.
