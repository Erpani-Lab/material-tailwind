## Video Best Practices for Developers

- Ensure proper aspect ratios
- Implement responsive behaviors
- Add loading states
- Include playback controls
- Optimize for performance
- Support accessibility features

<br />
Videos that autoplay with sound can be intrusive, so this restriction aims to improve the overall browsing experience.

However, videos that are muted are typically allowed to autoplay, making this combination useful for background videos, promotional content, or any scenario where immediate engagement is desired without audio disruption.
