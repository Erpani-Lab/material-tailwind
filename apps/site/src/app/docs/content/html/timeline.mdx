# Tailwind CSS Timeline

Use our Tailwind CSS Timeline component in your web projects.

The timeline is used to visualize the progression of activities, tasks, projects, or any series of events over time. A timeline can be horizontal or vertical, and it can include dates, text descriptions, icons, and sometimes images or links to provide more context about each event.

See below our beautiful Timeline examples that you can use in your Tailwind CSS project. The example also comes in different styles and colors so you can adapt it easily to your needs.

## Timeline Demo

Use this versatile vertical timeline example designed to display a series of events, each with a title and a descriptive text block.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="timeline/timeline-demo.tsx" language="html" />

## Timeline with Icon

Use the example below for a timeline component with icon to denote different events or stages. Each item in the timeline is presented as a separate list item (`<li>`), with visual indicators and descriptive content.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="timeline/timeline-with-icon.tsx" language="html" />

## Timeline with Avatar

Unlike traditional timeline elements that use abstract shapes or icons to denote events, this example uses images, specifically profile photos (avatars), to add a personal or human touch to each list item.

Each list item includes a title and a paragraph. The titles are prominent (`text-base font-bold text-black`), while the paragraphs provide additional information in a smaller, lighter font (`text-sm text-foreground`).

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="timeline/timeline-with-avatar.tsx" language="html" />

## Activities Timeline

This example showcases a well-structured, compact, and beautiful notification list designed using HTML and Tailwind CSS, featuring different notification items with specific icons and color codes.

## Timeline Best Practices for Developers

- Maintain consistent styling throughout the timeline for elements such as dates, event titles, and descriptions.
- Aim for brief, concise descriptions, and provide links to more detailed information if necessary.
- If the timeline is dense with information, consider adding interactive elements such as tooltips, pop-ups, or modals that provide more â€¢ details when users hover or click on an event.
- Use size, color, and typography to establish a visual hierarchy that guides users through the timeline.
