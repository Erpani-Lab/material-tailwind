# Tailwind CSS Timeline

Get started with our timeline components styled with Tailwind CSS. Perfect for displaying chronological events, project milestones, or activity feeds with clean layouts and proper spacing.

The timeline is used to visualize the progression of activities, tasks, projects, or any series of events over time. A timeline can be horizontal or vertical, and it can include dates, text descriptions, icons, and sometimes images or links to provide more context about each event.

See below our beautiful Timeline examples that you can use in your Tailwind CSS project. The example also comes in different styles and colors so you can adapt it easily to your needs.

## Timeline Demo

Looking for a simple timeline? This example shows how to create vertical event sequences using Tailwind CSS flex utilities, with proper spacing and alignment for each entry.

## Timeline with Icon

Transform your timelines by adding custom icons using Tailwind CSS grid utilities. Each event features an icon that visually represents its content or category.

## Timeline with Avatar

Unlike traditional timeline elements that use abstract shapes or icons to denote events, this example uses images, specifically profile photos (avatars), to add a personal or human touch to each list item.

Each list item includes a title and a paragraph. The titles are prominent (`text-base font-bold text-black`), while the paragraphs provide additional information in a smaller, lighter font (`text-sm text-foreground`).

This example showcases a well-structured, compact, and beautiful notification list designed using HTML and Tailwind CSS, featuring different notification items with specific icons and color codes.

## Timeline Best Practices for Developers

- Maintain consistent styling throughout the timeline for elements such as dates, event titles, and descriptions.
- Aim for brief, concise descriptions, and provide links to more detailed information if necessary.
- If the timeline is dense with information, consider adding interactive elements such as tooltips, pop-ups, or modals that provide more â€¢ details when users hover or click on an event.
- Use size, color, and typography to establish a visual hierarchy that guides users through the timeline.
