In the code snipped above, the animation applied to the spinner (`animate-spin`) adds movement, further indicating that a process is ongoing. The use of the `text-surface` class for coloring provides a subtle gray color, which maintains visibility while ensuring it doesn't distract too much from the content behind it and the `w-16 h-16` classes set a bigger size for the spinner.
