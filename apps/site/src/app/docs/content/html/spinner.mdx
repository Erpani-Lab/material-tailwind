## Spinner Colors

Need branded loaders? This example uses Tailwind CSS color utilities with `bg-slate-800`, `bg-slate-200`, `bg-blue-500`, `bg-green-500`, `bg-red-500`, and `bg-amber-500` for different states.

In the code snipped above, the animation applied to the spinner (`animate-spin`) adds movement, further indicating that a process is ongoing. The use of the `text-surface` class for coloring provides a subtle gray color, which maintains visibility while ensuring it doesn't distract too much from the content behind it and the `w-16 h-16` classes set a bigger size for the spinner.
