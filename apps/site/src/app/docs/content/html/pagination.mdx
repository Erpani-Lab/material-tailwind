# Tailwind CSS Pagination

Get started on your web projects with our Tailwind CSS pagination which is a compact elements that represent an input, attribute, or action. This element appears dynamically as a group of multiple interactive elements and allows users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions.

Pagination can significantly improve performance by limiting the amount of data loaded and rendered on a page at any given time. This reduction in data processing and rendering can lead to faster page load times and a smoother user experience.

See below our simple pagination component example that you can use for your Tailwind CSS project.

## Pagination Demo

In this example, the pagination has a consistent style with a rounded square shape (`h-10 w-10`) and are styled to differentiate the active page from others. For example, the button for page 1 has a `bg-primary text-white` class, indicating it might be the current page, while the others have `text-priimary` indicating they are not the selected page.

## Pagination Circular

This pagination component example uses `rounded-full` for all buttons, giving them a fully circular shape. This design choice can make the pagination component stand out more and provides a more stylish appearance.

<p class="mt-4 antialiased text-foreground">This pagination component is designed with simplicity and functionality in mind. It lacks page number buttons, focusing solely on navigation between sequential pages. This design choice might be suitable for scenarios where users are likely to navigate content linearly or when space is limited.</p>
