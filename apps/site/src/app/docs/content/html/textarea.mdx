# Tailwind CSS Textarea

Use our Tailwind CSS textarea if you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example, a comment on a review or feedback form.

The textarea UI components usually look like a rectangular box where users can type or paste text. The component often includes vertical or horizontal scrollbars when the content exceeds the visible area, labels, buttons, character counters, validation messages, and icons.

Developers use this component for content management systems, web forms, messaging apps, and more.

See below Material Tailwindâ€™s examples of textareas that come in different styles and use Tailwind CSS classes.

## Textarea Demo

Get started with a simple textarea that comes with rounded corners, border styles, and a label. The label is intelligently styled to transition smoothly when the textarea is focused, and it uses Tailwind CSS classes to achieve these effects.

## Textarea Best Practices For Developers
<ul class="mt-4 ml-4 space-y-2 list-disc list-outside text-foreground">
<li>Make sure that textareas are accessible to all users (including those with disabilities), using appropriate HTML attributes like `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` to provide meaningful labels and descriptions for screen readers.</li>
<li>Use descriptive and clear placeholder text to provide hints of the expected input.</li>
<li>Implement client-side validation for user input in textareas. Validate input for length, format, and any specific requirements.</li>
</ul>
