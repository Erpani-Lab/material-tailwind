# Tailwind CSS Switch

Use our Tailwind CSS switch component to let users adjust settings on/off. The option that the switch controls, as well as the state it's in, should be made clear from the corresponding inline label.

Switch components are used in various scenarios in web development, including settings options, feature toggles, form inputs, interactive controls, accessibility options, and more.

Use the following examples to create a simple and easy-to-use switch component for your Tailwind CSS project.

## Switch Demo

Use this simple component example that changes the background color, border color, and shadow of the switch when it is in the "checked" state.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="switch/switch-demo.tsx" language="html" />

---

## Switch Checked

In this example, you can see how to implement your switch to be checked by default.

## Switch Colors

Check out this example to see how you can create a colored diverse set of toggle switches that can be used for various settings or options in a web application.

## Switch with Label

See below how to create a custom switch component with a clear, descriptive label, making it suitable for settings pages, forms, or anywhere else where users need to make a binary choice.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="switch/switch-with-label.tsx" language="html" />

## Disabled Switch

This example illustrates a switch component designed to appear disabled and non-interactive. The key features indicating its disabled state include the use of the disabled attribute on the input element, as well as Tailwind CSS classes `opacity-50` and `pointer-events-none` applied to the `input` to visually and functionally disable the entire switch component.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="switch/disabled-switch.tsx" language="html" />

## Switch with Link

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="switch/switch-with-link.tsx" language="html" />

## Switch With Description

A switch component like the "Remember Me" example below is typically used in login forms or authentication pages on websites and applications.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="switch/switch-with-description.tsx" language="html" />
