# Tailwind CSS Checkbox

Get started on your web projects with our Tailwind CSS checkbox which is an input control that allows the user to select one or more items from a set. You can use a checkbox for:

- Selecting one or more options from a list
- Presenting a list containing sub-selections
- Turning an item on/off in a desktop environment (If you have a single option, avoid using a checkbox and use an on/off checkbox instead)

See below our easy-to-use checkbox component that you can use for your Tailwind CSS project.
