# Tailwind CSS Alerts

Create informative and responsive alert messages with our Tailwind CSS alert components. Perfect for displaying important notifications, feedback, or status messages to users without disrupting their workflow.

An alert displays a short and important message attracting the user's attention without interrupting the user's task. Use this element when you need to show highly-important messages to users or when you need a persistent static container that is closable by user actions.

Below we are presenting examples of alerts that you can use in your Tailwind CSS project. The examples come in different colors and styles so you can adapt them easily to your needs.
