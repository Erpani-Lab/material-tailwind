# Tailwind CSS Navbar

Get started with our responsive navbar components styled with Tailwind CSS. Perfect for creating navigation headers that help users easily access different sections of your website or application.

The navbar is usually located at the top of a webpage or along the side and it can be static (remains in the same position regardless of page scrolling), or dynamic (changes in response to user interactions). You can add links, icons, links with icons, search bars, and brand text.

See below our simple navbar example that you can use in your Tailwind CSS project.
