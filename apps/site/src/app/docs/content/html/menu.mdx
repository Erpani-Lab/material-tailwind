## Navbar Best Practices for Developers
<ul class="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside text-foreground">
<li>Avoid cluttering it with too many links and use clear, descriptive labels for navigation links.</li>
<li>Maintain consistency in the navbar's design across different pages of the website.</li>
<li>Use size, color, and placement to establish a visual hierarchy in your navbar.</li>
<li>Consider using a sticky or fixed navbar that remains visible as the user scrolls down the page.</li>
<li>For websites with extensive content or products, include a search bar within the navbar.</li>
</ul>
