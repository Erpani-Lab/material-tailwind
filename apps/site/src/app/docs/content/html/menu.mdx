# Tailwind CSS Menu

Use our responsive Tailwind CSS navbar for your website. It is a navigation tool, that helps users to easily access different sections or pages of a website or application.

The navbar is usually located at the top of a webpage or along the side and it can be static (remains in the same position regardless of page scrolling), or dynamic (changes in response to user interactions). You can add links, icons, links with icons, search bars, and brand text.

See below our simple navbar example that you can use in your Tailwind CSS project.

## Menu Demo

Use this simple navbar example with navigational links and buttons that get the user's attention to perform specific actions, like "Log in".

## Manu Placement

This component example presents a cleaner design navbar styled with `sticky top-0`, making it stick to the top of the viewport as the page scrolls down. Users can easily navigate through the website while engaging with the content, and the sticky navbar makes sure that navigation options are always within reach.

## Menu with Divider

This navbar component example includes an interactive search input field and a corresponding search button, alowing users to search content directly from the navbar. This feature helps users to quickly access information without navigating away from the current view.

## Menu with Checkbox

In this example, the navbar uses a black background styled with Tailwind CSS (`bg-black`), creating a dark mode design.

## Menu with Search

Use this minimalist navbar that can be used across a wide range of websites and web applications where navigation clarity is important.

## Menu with Scrolling Content

This example shows a navbar with a scrolling content area. The content area is scrollable, allowing users to view more content than what is initially visible.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="menu/menu-with-scrolling-content.tsx" language="html" />

## Notification Menu

This example shows a notification menu with a badge that displays the number of unread notifications.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="menu/notification-menu.tsx" language="html" />

---

## Profile Menu

## Navbar Best Practices for Developers
<ul class="space-y-2 list-disc list-inside text-foreground">
<li>Avoid cluttering it with too many links and use clear, descriptive labels for navigation links.</li>
<li>Maintain consistency in the navbar's design across different pages of the website.</li>
<li>Use size, color, and placement to establish a visual hierarchy in your navbar.</li>
<li>Consider using a sticky or fixed navbar that remains visible as the user scrolls down the page.</li>
<li>For websites with extensive content or products, include a search bar within the navbar.</li>
</ul>
