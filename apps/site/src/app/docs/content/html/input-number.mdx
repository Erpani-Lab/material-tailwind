# Tailwind CSS Input Number

The input number component allows users to enter and adjust numeric values easily, and it is usually found in forms and applications. 

Compared to a <a href="/docs/html/input" class="underline">basic input</a>, it restricts entries to numbers only, often includes increment/decrement buttons, and can enforce minimum and maximum limits to ensure valid data entry.

This component improves user experience, ensures data consistency, and supports accessibility.
See our Tailwind CSS input number examples below. They come in different styles and colors, allowing you to easily adapt them to your needs.
