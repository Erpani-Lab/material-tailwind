# Tailwind CSS Radio Button

Our Tailwind CSS radio button component will let your users choose only one of a predefined set of mutually exclusive options.

Radio buttons are circular and typically appear in groups; when a user selects one radio button in a group, any previously selected radio button in the same group is automatically deselected. This behavior makes sure that the user can choose only one option from the group, making radio buttons ideal for choices where only one option is applicable.

Use the following example to create simple radio buttons for your projects.

## Radio Button Demo

The example features two radio buttons, labeled "HTML" and "React", allowing users to select one of these two options.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="radio/radio-demo.tsx" language="html" />

---

## Radio Button Colors

This example showcases a set of custom-styled radio buttons designed for selecting colors, with options for `primary`, `secondary`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, and `error`.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="radio/radio-colors.tsx" language="html" />

## Radio Button with Custom Icon

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="radio/radio-with-custom-icon.tsx" language="html" />

---

## Disabled Radio Button

Both radio buttons are explicitly marked as disabled using the disabled attribute on the `<input>` elements. This attribute prevents users from being able to select these options, making sure the form behaves correctly in contexts where "HTML" and "React" options should not be selectable.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="radio/disabled-radio.tsx" language="html" />

## Radio Button with Link

This example showcases how you can implement radio buttons with labels that includes a hyperlink.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="radio/radio-with-link.tsx" language="html" />

## Radio Button With Description

This example presents a radio button example that incorporates detailed descriptions. This is a more complex and informative approach to presenting radio button options.
