# Tailwind CSS Radio

Get started with our radio components styled with Tailwind CSS. Perfect for creating single-choice selections in forms with smooth transitions and accessible design.

Radio buttons are circular and typically appear in groups; when a user selects one radio button in a group, any previously selected radio button in the same group is automatically deselected. This behavior makes sure that the user can choose only one option from the group, making radio buttons ideal for choices where only one option is applicable.

Use the following example to create simple radio buttons for your projects.
