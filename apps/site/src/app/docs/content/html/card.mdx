# Tailwind CSS Card

Use our cards to provide a flexible and extensible content container based on Tailwind CSS with multiple variants and options.

By its definition, a card is a sheet of material that serves as an entry point to more detailed information. Cards usually include a photo, text, and a link about a single subject. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Elements, like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

See below our beautiful Tailwind CSS card examples that you can use in your web and app projects.
