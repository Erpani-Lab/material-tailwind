# Tailwind CSS Rating

Get started with our rating components styled with Tailwind CSS. Perfect for collecting user feedback in e-commerce, content platforms, or service reviews with intuitive star-based interactions.

Rating components are used in various web projects, including ecommerce websites for product reviews, content platforms for rating movies or articles, and service-oriented websites where users can rate their satisfaction.

The most used representation is the 5-star rating system, where users can select from 1 to 5 stars to rate a product, service, content, or experience, with 1 star indicating the lowest satisfaction and 5 stars indicating the highest.

Whether you need a simple star rating system or a more intricate form with half-star ratings, Material Tailwind has got you covered.
