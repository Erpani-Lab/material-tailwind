# Tailwind CSS Rating

Collect user feedback with our Tailwind CSS Rating component â€“ a versatile UI element for effortlessly integrating ratings and reviews into your web applications.

Rating components are used in various web projects, including ecommerce websites for product reviews, content platforms for rating movies or articles, and service-oriented websites where users can rate their satisfaction.

The most used representation is the 5-star rating system, where users can select from 1 to 5 stars to rate a product, service, content, or experience, with 1 star indicating the lowest satisfaction and 5 stars indicating the highest.

Whether you need a simple star rating system or a more intricate form with half-star ratings, Material Tailwind has got you covered.

## Rating Demo

In this example, the filled stars are rendered with `fill="currentColor"` and given a Tailwind class `text-yellow-700`, which likely applies a shade of yellow color, making them stand out as active or selected ratings. The color choice for the filled stars (yellow) is a common convention for indicating positive or high ratings.
