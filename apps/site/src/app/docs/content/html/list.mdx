## List with Icon

Use this example of a list with action buttons (icons). It is a more interactive variant of a list, where each item not only serves as an interactive element navigation or selection) but also includes a button for performing specific actions, such as deletion, editing, or more, indicated by the SVG icon within each button.

## List with Badge

This example adds notification badges to each list item, indicating the number of items or messages within each category ("Inbox", "Spam", "Trash"). These badges provide a visual cue to users about the status or content volume associated with each section.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="list/list-with-badge.tsx" language="html" />

## List with Selected Item

In this example, the initial state of the first item ("Inbox") differs slightly from the others; it has a semi-transparent background (`data-selected="true"` or `bg-slate-200`) that distinguishes it from the rest, indicating a selected or default state.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="list/list-with-selected-item.tsx" language="html" />

## List with Disabled Item

## List with Link

This component example includes `<a href="#">` anchor tags wrapping around each list item, effectively turning each item into a clickable link that can navigate to other pages or execute actions.
