# Tailwind CSS Avatar - React

Our React `Avatar` component is used to represent people or objects in your web projects. The avatar component usually displays a profile picture or a placeholder graphic if no image is available. Commonly places for avatars include: user profiles, comment sections, user lists, and anywhere else where a visual representation of a user is needed.

To jumpstart your development process, we offer a range of pre-designed `Avatar` examples that are ready to be integrated into your project. All our examples are based on React and styled with Tailwind CSS.
