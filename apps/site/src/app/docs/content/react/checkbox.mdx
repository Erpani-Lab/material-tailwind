# Tailwind CSS Checkbox - React

Use our Tailwind CSS `Checkbox` component to allow the user to select one or more items from a set.

You can use a checkbox for:

- Selecting one or more options from a list.
- Presenting a list containing sub-selections.
- Turning an item on/off in a desktop environment (If you have a single option, avoid using a checkbox and use an on/off switch instead).

See below our `Checkbox` component examples that you can use in your Tailwind CSS and React project. The examples comes in different styles and colors, so you can adapt it easily to your needs.

## Checkbox Demo

## Checkbox Colors

We provide different checkbox colors like `primary`, `secondary`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, and `error` so you can adapt it easily to your needs. You can simply use the `color` prop to change the checkbox color.

In the example below, we've showcased the different checkbox colors that you can use in your project.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="checkbox/checkbox-colors.tsx" language="react" />

## Checkbox with Label

The `Checkbox` component can be used with a label to provide more context to the user. In the example below, we've added a label to the checkbox by using the `Checkbox` and `Typography` components together.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="checkbox/checkbox-with-label.tsx" language="react" />

## Checkbox with Custom Icon

You can customize and change the icon used for the checkbox by using new icons inside the `Checkbox.Indicator` component. In the example below, we use the `Star` and `StarSolid` icons for `checked` and `unchecked` states.

To make it work, you need to use `group-data-[checked=true]` for the icons to show/hide based on the checkbox state.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="checkbox/checkbox-with-custom-icon.tsx" language="react" />

## Disabled Checkbox

You can disable the checkbox by adding the `disabled` prop. This will prevent the user from interacting with the checkbox.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="checkbox/disabled-checkbox.tsx" language="react" />

## Checkbox with Link

Use the example below to create a `Checkbox` component with a link to the terms and conditions inside it's label.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="checkbox/checkbox-with-link.tsx" language="react" />

## Checkbox With Description

Use the example below to create a `Checkbox` component with a title and description as it's label to provide more information about the checkbox action.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="checkbox/checkbox-with-description.tsx" language="react" />

## Checkbox Custom Styles

You can use `className` prop to customize the `Checkbox` component style. In the example below, we make the checkbox circular.
