# Tailwind CSS Progress - React

Our React and Tailwind CSS progressbar can be used to show a user how far along he is in a process. The progress can be determinate or indeterminate. Use the Progress Bar to show an ongoing process that takes a noticeable time to finish.

Below we are presenting our examples of `Progress` component that you can use in your Tailwind CSS and React project. It comes in different styles and colors, so you can adapt it easily to your needs.
