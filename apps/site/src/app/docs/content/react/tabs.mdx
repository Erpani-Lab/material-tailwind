# Tailwind CSS Tabs - React

Get started on your web project with our responsive React and Tailwind CSS `Tabs` that create a secondary navigational hierarchy for your website.

Tabs are components that render and display subsections to users. They arrange the content into categories for easy access and a cleaner-looking app.

See below our examples that will help you create a simple and easy-to-use `Tabs` for your Tailwind CSS and React project.
