# Tailwind CSS Radio Button - React

Our Tailwind CSS `Radio` button component will let your users choose only one of a predefined set of mutually exclusive options. `Radio` buttons should be used instead of checkboxes if only one item can be selected from a list.

See below our `Radio` button component examples that you can use in your Tailwind CSS and React project. The examples comes in different styles and colors, so you can adapt it easily to your needs.

## Radio Button with Custom Icon

You can customize and change the icon used for the radio button by using new icons inside the `Radio.Indicator` component. In the example below, we use the `Star` and `StarSolid` icons for `checked` and `unchecked` states.

To make it work, you need to use `group-data-[checked=true]` for the icons to show/hide based on the checkbox state.
