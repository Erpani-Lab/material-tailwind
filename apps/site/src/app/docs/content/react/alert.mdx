# Tailwind CSS Alert - React

Get started on your web projects with our React and Tailwind CSS `Alert` component which provides contextual feedback messages for typical user actions.

An alert displays a short and important message attracting the user's attention without interrupting the user's task. Use this element when you need to show highly-important messages to users or when you need a persistent static container that is closable by user actions.

See below our `Alert` component examples that you can use in your Tailwind CSS and React project. The example also comes in different styles and colors, so you can adapt it easily to your needs.
