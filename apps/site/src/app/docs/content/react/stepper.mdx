# Tailwind CSS Stepper - React

Use our React and Tailwind CSS stepper in your web projects. The stepper can be used for multi-step processes or forms. You can easily create stepper using our `Timeline` component with the `mode` prop set to `stepper`.

See below our beautiful stepper component examples that you can use in your Tailwind CSS and React project. The example also comes in different styles so you can adapt it easily to your needs.

## Stepper with Icon

You can use icons in your stepper by adding icon to the `Timeline.Icon` component to make it more visually appealing. Use the example below to create a stepper with icons.

In the example below we've used the [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com/) icons, but you can use any other icon library you prefer.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="stepper/stepper-with-icon.tsx" language="react" />

## Stepper with Dots

You can use dots in your stepper by not adding any content to the `Timeline.Icon` component, this will create a stepper with dots instead of numbers or icons.

## Stepper With Content

You can add extra content for each step of the stepper. Use the example below to create a stepper with specific content for its steps.

In the example below we've used the [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com/) icons, but you can use any other icon library you prefer.

## Stepper Custom Styles

You can use the `className` prop to customize the `Timeline` component style and make your own custom stepper. In the example below, we've showcased a custom stepper with a purple background color and rounded corners.
