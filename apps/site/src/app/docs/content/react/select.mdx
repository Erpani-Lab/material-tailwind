# Tailwind CSS Select - React

Use our Tailwind CSS `Select` component to collect user provided information from a list of options.

A `Select` component is a dropdown menu for displaying choices. Use the `Radio` button component when there are fewer total options (less than 5) and use the `Select` component when there is more options and choices.

See below our `Select` component example that you can use in your Tailwind CSS and React project. The example comes in different colors and styles, so you can adapt it easily to your needs.

## Select Controlled

The `Select` component could be either a controlled or uncontrolled component by default the component is uncontrolled but you can make it controlled by using the `value` and `onValueChange` props.

You can disable the `Select` component by adding the `disabled` prop. This will prevent the user from interacting with the `Select` component.
