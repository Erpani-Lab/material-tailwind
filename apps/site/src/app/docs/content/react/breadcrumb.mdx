# Tailwind CSS Breadcrumb - React

Use our React and Tailwind CSS `Breadcrumb` component to simply create beautiful `Breadcrumb` for your pages with Material Tailwind.

Breadcrumb is website links that allow users to track where they are on a website and how far they are from the homepage. They are highly important elements for your search engine optimisation (SEO) and user experience.

See below our versatile `Breadcrumb` component examples that you can use in your Tailwind CSS and React project.

## Breadcrumb Demo

Here's how to implement a simple and responsive `Breadcrumb` component. It can be used to show the user where they are on a website and how far they are from the homepage.

## Breadcrumb with Icon

You can add icons to your `Breadcrumb` links to make them more visually appealing and easier to understand.

In the example below we've used the [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com/) icons, but you can use any other icon library you prefer.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="breadcrumb/breadcrumb-with-icon.tsx" language="react" />

## Breadcrumb Custom Separator

You can customize the breadcrumb separator by adding any text or icon to the `Breadcrumb.Separator` component.

<PreviewWithCode relativePath="breadcrumb/breadcrumb-custom-separator.tsx" language="react" />

## Breadcrumb Custom Styles

You can use the `className` prop to customize the `Breadcrumb` component style and make your own custom breadcrumb links.

In the example below we've used the [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com/) icons, but you can use any other icon library you prefer.
