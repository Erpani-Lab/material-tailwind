# Tailwind CSS Popover - React

Our `Popover` component for Tailwind CSS & React is a small overlay of content that is used to demonstrate secondary information of any component when a user clicks it.

See below our `Popover` component examples that you can use in your web project.

## Popover Demo

Here's how to implement a simple `Popover` component. It can be used to display secondary information of any component when a user clicks it.

## Popover Placement

You can change the placement of the `Popover` component by using the `placement` prop. The `placement` prop like `top`, `top-start`, `top-end`, `right`, `right-start`, `right-end`, `bottom`, `bottom-start`, `bottom-end`, `left`, `left-start`, and `left-end`. This will help you to position the `Popover` component in the desired location.
