# Tailwind CSS Accordion - React

Use our React `Accordion` component to allow the user to show and hide sections of related content on a page. There are many ways to use this component, like displaying a list of FAQs, showing various menus and submenus, displaying the locations of a particular company, and so on.

See below our simple and versatile `accordion` examples that you can use in your projects. All our examples are based on React and styled with Tailwind CSS. We also included some Accordion props that are available.
