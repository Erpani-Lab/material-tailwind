# Tailwind CSS Badge - React

Use our React `Badge` component to show status in your web projects. The `Badge` can be used as a visual identifier for notifications on your website.

See below our beautiful `Badge` examples that you can use in your Tailwind CSS and React project. The example also comes in different styles and colors so you can adapt it easily to your needs.

For the examples below we used [Iconoir](https://iconoir.com/) icons but you can use any icon library you prefer.
