# Tailwind CSS Input - React

Easily create `Input` with different statuses and sizes using our components based on Tailwind CSS and React.

Input fields are an essential user interface design element, providing users with the means to enter non-standardized responses.

See below our `Input` component examples. It comes in different styles and colors, so you can adapt it easily to your needs.
