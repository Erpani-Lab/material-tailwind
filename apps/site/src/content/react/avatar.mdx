# Tailwind CSS Avatar - React

Use our `Avatar` based on Tailwind CSS for actions in forms, dialogues, and more.

`Avatar` is an essential element of web design. Basically,
`Avatar` is styled links that grab the user's attention. They help users
navigate our websites or apps and drive them to a particular action like submitting
a contact form or placing an order as easy as possible.

See below our `Avatar` example that you can use in your Tailwind CSS and React project. The example also comes in different styles and colors, so you can adapt it easily to your needs.
