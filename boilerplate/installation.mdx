## Setup .env
</DocsTitle>

Rename the <Code>.env.example</Code> to <Code>.env</Code>, run the command below to rename the env file.

```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

<br />

Once it's done open the <Code>.env</Code> file and you will see the below code:

```env
# base
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-supabase-service-role-key>

# stripe
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-stripe-publishable-key>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your-stripe-secret-key>
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<your-stripe-webhook-secret>

# google analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_TAG_ID=<your-google-tag-manage-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=<your-google-analytics-id>

# galichat
NEXT_PUBLIC_GALICHAT_HASH=<your-galichat-hash>
```

<br />

For the moment we only need to setup Supabase inorder to work.

Go to the Supabase dashboard and create a new project and copy/paste your <Code>NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL</Code>, <Code>NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY</Code> and <Code>SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY</Code>
