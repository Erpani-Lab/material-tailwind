# Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive framework that uses Material Tailwind for building UI components. The framework consists of React and HTML versions with their respective documentation located under the `/apps/site` directory, while the core frameworks are in `/packages/react` and `/packages/html`.

## Structure

- **/apps/site**: Contains the main site that includes the documentation.
- **/packages/react**: Hosts the React component library leveraging Material Tailwind.
- **/packages/html**: Includes the HTML component library styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Frameworks

### React Framework

- Utilizes advanced React features to build reusable UI components.
- Focus on component flexibility and customization via props and themes.

### HTML Framework (Tailwind CSS)

- Provides pure HTML components styled with Tailwind CSS for lightweight and scalable front-end solutions.
- Emphasizes rapid prototyping and ease of integration into static HTML pages.

## Main Ideas for Improvements

1. **Consistent Design Language**:
   - Ensure coherence in design between React and HTML components.
   - Utilize Tailwind's theming to maintain a consistent color palette and typography.

2. **Component Performance**:
   - Optimize React components for better performance using techniques like memoization.
   - Minimize DOM manipulation in the HTML components for faster loading times.

3. **Documentation Enhancements**:
   - Extend the current documentation by providing more examples and usage scenarios.

4. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Ensure all components comply with the latest accessibility standards.

5. **Testing**:
   - Increase test coverage for both React and HTML components to ensure reliability.
